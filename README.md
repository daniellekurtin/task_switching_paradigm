# Task Switching Paradigm

Hello! This cued, task switching paradigm switches between three tasks: the spatial rotation, digit span, and spatial span. This task was coded with the intent for other researchers to modify it to suit their experimental needs, so please, pull it and play!

This task was coded to be MRI and EEG compatible, and thus requires installation of this package:

       pip install git+https://github.com/tiborauer/pyniexp.git

If you have any questions please reach out to me at danielle.kurtin18@imperial.ac.uk. Happy task switching!
